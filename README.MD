## Shortest Path App Project

The Shortest Path App solves the task of finding the shortest path from the top-left to the bottom-right of a grid for [WaveMoney's assessment](./instructions.MD). It offers two famous algorithms: BFS, A* (A Star), and allows for the flexibility to incorporate additional algorithms through the PathService contract.

### Docker (Optional)

This step is optional and is solely for building the Docker image.

```Shell
mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
docker build -t taaesan/shortest-path-app:latest ./shortest-path-app 
docker push taaesan/shortest-path-app:latest
```


## Kubernetes Deployment (Optional)  
I've deployed the application on Kubernetes to provide scalability and for the sake of experimentation. However, setting it up requires several software installations and commands. If you're interested, please refer to the instructions below.

### Required software
- Minikube https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/
- Kubctl https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/
- Helm https://github.com/helm/helm/releases
- K6 https://k6.io/docs/get-started/installation/

### Install ingress controller (Minikube)  
https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#minikube



### Instructions
0. Run the following commands.  
```Shell
minikube start  
minikube addons enable ingress  
minikube addons list 
|ingress| minikube | enabled âœ…| Kubernetes|
minikube tunnel  
```  
1. Run kubectl command
`kubectl apply -f /k8s`  
2. Check running pod
`kubectl get pods`  
```Shell
NAME                                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
shortest-path-app-deployment-7c9fdd8cdc-q8bmw   1/1     Running   0          3h57m
```

### Load Test
`k6 run k6/script.k8s.js`
