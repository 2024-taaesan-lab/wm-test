Programming Test: Path Finding in a Grid


Overview


Your task is to implement an algorithm that finds a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a 2D grid. The grid is represented by a matrix of integers, where 0 represents an obstacle that cannot be crossed, and 1 represents a cell that can be traversed. Your algorithm should find a path that traverses the grid using the smallest number of steps possible. You are allowed to move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.


Objectives

Algorithm Efficiency: Your solution should efficiently find the shortest path, considering time and space complexity.
Scalability: The solution should be scalable, and capable of handling a grid of significant size (e.g., 1000x1000 cells).
Maintainability: Your code should be well-organized, commented, and easy to maintain.
Requirements

Fully Commented Source Code: Your submission must include source code with comprehensive comments explaining the logic and choices made in your implementation. Use meaningful variable names and include comments that describe the purpose of each part of the code.
Unit Test: Provide unit tests for your code that cover various scenarios, including but not limited to:
Small grids (e.g., 5x5)
Large grids (e.g., 1000x1000)
Grids with no possible path
Grids with multiple possible paths (your algorithm should find the shortest)
Build Instructions: Include detailed instructions on how to build your project, specifying any dependencies, required libraries, or frameworks.
Run Instructions: Provide clear instructions on how to run your application, including how to execute unit tests. Mention any command-line arguments or input formats your program expects.
Evaluation Criteria

Correctness: The algorithm must correctly find the shortest path if one exists.
Performance: The solution should demonstrate high performance, especially on larger grids.
Code Quality: Code should be clean, well-commented, and follow best practices in software development.
Test Coverage: Unit tests should cover a wide range of cases and effectively demonstrate the correctness and robustness of the solution.
Submission Guidelines

Submit your solution as a ZIP file containing all the necessary files to build, test, and run your application.
Ensure that your submission includes a README file with clear build and run instructions, as well as a brief explanation of your algorithm and any assumptions made during its development.
This test is designed to showcase your problem-solving skills, coding abilities, and attention to detail. We are looking for clear, efficient, and maintainable code, as well as a deep understanding of algorithms and data structures.
